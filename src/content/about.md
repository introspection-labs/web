# About Dawn

Dawn is a speech-to-text application designed specifically for macOS, powered by advanced AI technology. Our mission is to make voice transcription accessible to everyone, which is why Dawn is free forever.

## Our Mission

We believe that your thoughts shouldn't cost you. Whether you're taking notes, transcribing interviews, or simply want to convert your spoken words into text, Dawn provides a seamless and intuitive experience that works right on your Mac.

> "The best tools are the ones that get out of your way and let you focus on what matters most."

Dawn was created with the understanding that voice transcription should be simple, fast, and accessible to everyone—not just those who can afford expensive subscriptions.

## Features

Dawn offers a comprehensive set of features designed to enhance your productivity:

- **AI-Powered Transcription**: Advanced speech recognition technology that accurately converts your voice to text
- **Real-Time Processing**: See your words appear on screen as you speak
- **Offline Capability**: Process audio locally when possible for enhanced privacy
- **macOS Native**: Built specifically for Mac with full system integration
- **Free Forever**: No subscriptions, no hidden fees, no limits

Whether you're a student taking lecture notes, a journalist conducting interviews, or a professional documenting meetings, Dawn adapts to your workflow.

## Privacy

Built with privacy in mind, Dawn processes your audio locally when possible, ensuring that your conversations remain private and secure. We're committed to providing a tool that enhances productivity without compromising on user privacy or experience.

Your data stays on your device. We don't collect your transcriptions, we don't sell your information, and we don't track your usage. Privacy isn't a feature—it's a fundamental right.

For more details, please see our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

## Getting Started

Getting started with Dawn is simple. Just download the app, grant microphone permissions, and start speaking. The interface is designed to be intuitive, so you can focus on what you're saying, not how to use the tool.

If you have any questions or need assistance, we're here to help. Dawn is constantly evolving based on user feedback, and we're always working to make it better.

## The Future

We're constantly working to improve Dawn and add new features based on user feedback. Our roadmap includes support for multiple languages, custom vocabulary, and enhanced formatting options.

Thank you for choosing Dawn. We're excited to be part of your productivity journey.
